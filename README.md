### Dataset:
This project uses synthetic patient data generated with **Syntheaâ„¢**, a tool that creates realistic (but not real) health records in multiple formats. I generated a dataset of 110 patients in CSV format by running the command below. You can find more details about Synthea on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).
<pre> ``` run_synthea -p 110 ``` </pre>
