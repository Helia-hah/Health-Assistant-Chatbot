# Health Assistant Chatbot
Health Assistant Chatbot is a Gradio-based interactive application powered by a large language model (LLM) — OpenAI's GPT (gpt-4o-mini) — designed to assist health professionals in querying and visualizing patient data. It supports both text and voice input and provides text-to-speech responses for accessibility.

## Features 🚀

- 🎤⌨️ **Multi-modal input:** Supports both **text** and **audio** inputs for flexible interaction.
- 🔊 **Multi-modal output:** Provides text responses with an option for text-to-speech playback.
- 🩺 **Patient data tools:**
  1. 📋 **Information retrieval:** Access detailed patient information including immunizations, medications, observations (vital signs, lab results, and more).
  2. 📈 **Visualization:** Plot vital signs and physical characteristics such as height, weight, and BMI.
  3. 🔍 **Analysis:** Analyze vital signs to detect out-of-range values and identify abnormalities using statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, sudden changes, and trends.

### 🗃️ Dataset
This project uses synthetic patient data generated with **Synthea™**, a tool that creates realistic (but not real) health records in multiple formats. I generated a dataset of 110 patients in CSV format by running the command below. You can find more details about Synthea on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea).
<pre> run_synthea -p 110 </pre>
